✅ StarPay – XCB-Based Global Payment System

🌐 Introduction

StarPay is a next-generation, smart contract-driven global payment system optimized for tourism and small-scale cross-border transactions. It uses XCB, a stable digital currency with automatic liquidity and full legal compliance, to provide a seamless and safe financial experience for global users.

🧠 Core Objectives

Eliminate the cost and legal risks of cross-border transfers

Provide instant local-node transactions with synchronized global fund mobility

Ensure transparency, fund safety, and government compliance via smart contract

User Nodes (Personal Wallets, App Clients)

National Nodes (Country-based XCB Master Accounts and Gateways)

Smart Contracts (Fund routing, compliance, fee logic)

Regulatory Access Layer (Auditable data interface for legal transparency)



🏦 Liquidity Model

Fully convertible via partnered banks or exchanges
